          I am Jeffrey Eldridge, a software engineer based out of Portland,
          Oregon. I have used several different languages in my career so far,
          including javascript, C#, golang, objective-c, ruby, and others. I
          have worked professionally on web apps and desktop apps for both MacOS
          and Windows. I pride myself on being able to pick up and learn
          whatever tools I need to solve a problem.
