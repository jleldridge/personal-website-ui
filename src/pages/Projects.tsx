          Abstract is a tool that leverages the
          power of version control to allow design teams to collaborate and more
          effectively hand design assets off to developers. While at Abstract I
          worked on the full stack of the app, from adding server and desktop
          code to parse and version control design documents, to bringing our
          own designs to life in the UX on the web and desktop apps.

            Monarch is Datawatch's premier self-service data preparation tool
            targeting Windows desktops. While working at Datawatch, I have
            designed and developed UI workflows and backend code for data
            extraction methods, data connectors, data transforms, joins, and
            more. I have also helped to integrate Monarch with Datawatch's{" "}

            Following their acquisition by Datawatch, I worked on-site with
            Panopticon Software in Stockholm to bring Panopticonâ€™s data
            visualization software into the Datawatch software suite. During
            this time I was primarily focused on improving the software's UI,
            but I also created UI and backend code for data connectors that
            allow Datawatch software to connect to IBM Cognos TM1, IBM Cloudant,
            and streaming data sources. I primarily used C# and XAML, but there
            were occasions where I worked on backend code written in Java.

            Scrawler is a note taking / drawing app I designed primarily for the
            Microsoft Surface line of tablets. It was mostly intended for
            personal use, as I was dissatisfied with many of the free drawing
            apps offered for the Surface. The app never made it to the stage
            where I could polish the visuals, but it was eventually
            feature-complete enough to use it both to take notes, and to sketch
            and export the icons used in the app itself (hence the sketchy
            appearance of the icons).

            Amoeboid is the working name of a simple browser game that I created
            using vanilla javascript. The game was inspired by an old flash game
            I used to play in school called Hungry Space. The goal of the game
            is to eat (via collision) everything smaller than you while avoiding
            everything larger than you. Movement is accomplished with the WASD
            keys and I payed particular attention to trying to capture the
            slippery effect of movement in a low friction environment to add
            challenge and finesse to the controls. As the player eats more
            enemies, they gradually become larger, making more enemies edible,
            but also making it more difficult to maneuver around larger enemies.
            The game is won when there are no more enemies large enough to eat
            the player.
